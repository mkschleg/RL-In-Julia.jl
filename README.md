# RL in Julia - A tutorial

This tutorial is aimed at getting reinforcement learning researchers up and running in using Julia for their daily driver.
The aim of these tutorials is to give a brief overview of Julia, and start discussing various design patterns which I've
found useful in my research. While this may seem straightforward if coming from a language like Python, I recommend giving
it a full read. While Julia and Python have very similar syntaxes, they differ wildly in the core concepts of the language
leading to major shifts in designs (many of which I find more appealing than what is offered by OO languages). While this 
is pitched towards RL researchers, ML researchers would also find a lot of use as there is considerable overlap.

A brief overview:
- Basic Julia syntax and core concepts
- Introduction to an RL interface
- Getting down and dirty with flux
- Project structure and organization
- Running experiments and saving data
- Advanced topics
