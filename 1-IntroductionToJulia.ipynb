    "\n",
    "These are only a few reasons, but those I find most beautiful about julia. As we develop our reinforcement learning framework from scratch, I would like you to consider how you would implement these ideas in python. For example, what libraries would you need? What class structure? How would I change behavior? I've found my code significantly simplifies as I try to do things the Julia way (taking full advantage of multiple dispatch).\n",
